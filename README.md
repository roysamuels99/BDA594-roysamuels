## My Definition of Big Data
Big Data are extremely large and complicated volumes of information, which cannot be effectively treated with the help of traditional tools. 
It is not just the volume of data, but its variety, velocity, and veracity. In practice, Big Data allows organizations to identify trends, 
make predictions, and enable improved decision-making through the results of information collected across multiple sources. such as social 
media, sensors, business transactions, or scientific experiments.
